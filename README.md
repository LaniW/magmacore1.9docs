# Magma Core 1.9.0 Installation Personal Documentation
This is a repository for the personal documentation I followed for my Magma Orchestrator, NMS, and AGW installation. It was done with a bare metal Ubuntu 22.04 machine for the Orchestrator and NMS and a docker Ubuntu 20.04 VM for the AGW. It was written in November 2025.
